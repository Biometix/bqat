BQAT is a biometric quality assessment tool for generating and analysing given biometric samplesâ€™ quality to international standards as well as to customized metrics. The BQAT tool functions by taking an input directory of biometric data and will produce both the raw quality information as well as an analysis report.

## __Modules__

### Fingerprint:

The analysis of fingerprint engine based on NIST/NFIQ2 quality features. The quality score links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance.

### Face:

The face image assessment provides metrics includes head pose, smile detection, inter-eye-distance, closed eyes, etc.

### Iris:

The face image assessment provides various quality attributes, features, and ISO metrics.
